You may add any form of indentation. A TGL line may look like this: ! mc defstr hello,\"Hello, World!\" ; Define a string Let's disect this line! SOL (Start of line) All TGL lines MUST begin with a lone '!' . Note that TGL might not catch it if you don't include it but your ASM will catch them. The following is invalid: mc defstr - No '!' !mc defstr - No space after '!' Module The word right after '!' , in our case the module name is mc , which stands for 'macros' The whole functionality of TGL is hidden behind modules, each module has different inner workings and provides different functionalities. Function The second word is the name of the function, in our case it's the function defstr Modules export various functions, these functions decide how to change the ASM, what to add. Arguments Functions take different arguments. When in doubt, check this documentation. The arguments can be of following types: Name Example Explanation string \"Hello\\n\\0\" A simple string variable, enclosed in double quotes int 123 An integer value label buffer A label in code (code label, memory label) register rax A register name In our example there are two arguments A label named hello A string with the value of \"Hello, World!\" Arguments should always be separated by ',' , you may include whitespace around the ',' Comments And lastly, as with any ASM code, ';' marks the beginning of a comment.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"basics.html#basics-of-transgalactic","text":"","title":"Basics of transgalactic"},{"location":"basics.html#syntax-in-code","text":"Transgalactic (TGL) works on a single line basis (Do not attempt to split a single command over multiple lines).

Advanced options The following options interact with Transgalactic on a prime level and may cause errors if mishandled. --global-prefix-override GLOBAL_PREFIX_OVERRIDE By default Transgalactic uses a random UUIDv4 for label names to avoid name conflicts. You may use this option to override this behavior and instead use your own prefix (note that the prefix must abide by the rules for label names for NASM).

They are basically just a fancy way of doing find + replace. Here is the documentation for them .data section defstr defstr NAME, STR_VALUE label NAME - the name to define string STR_VALUE - a string value to define This macro deines the given string under the given label and should be used in .data and .rodata sections. It also defines an assembler constant in the format NAME_len , which holds the string length. .bss section resstr resstr NAME, SIZE label NAME - the name of the bss label int SIZE - size to reserve (in bytes) This macro reserves space for a string under the given label and should be used in .bss section. It also defines an assembler constant in the format NAME_len , which holds the given size. .text section printdef Stands for print and define or print already defined . This macro can take different arguments. Just print string printdef STR_VAL string STR_VAL - the string to print This will define the string under a random identifier and add ASM code to print it. This is for one-time prints of constant strings. Print and define printdef NAME, STR_VAL label NAME - the label to define the string under string STR_VAL - the string to print Useful when you want to re-use the string in other parts of the code. Note: Consider using defstr for better readability and code structure. Print already defined printdef NAME label NAME - the defined label to print This function ASSUMES that you defined a label NAME and now you want to use it. Note: This function also assumes the existence of a NAME_len assembler constant which it uses for the string length. (If you wish to print a dynamic string, check out std print ) exit exit CODE int CODE - Exit code of the program Make a syscall to SYS_EXIT with the corresponding return code. inpdef inpdef NAME, SIZE label NAME - the name of the bss variable int SIZE - size to reserve and input (in bytes) This macro defines a .bss variable with the label NAME and defines the asm constant NAME_len with the value of SIZE . Then calls the stdin syscall. inp inp NAME label NAME - the name of the bss variable This macro assumes the existence of the .bss variable NAME and the asm constant NAME_len . Then calls the stdin syscall. strcp strcp FROM, TO label FROM - the source string label TO - the destination string This macro will copy the contents of the FROM string into the TO string. Note: The FROM string must be NULL terminated strncp strcp FROM, TO, LEN label FROM - the source string label TO - the destination string int LEN - max characters to copy This macro will copy the contents of the FROM string into the TO string.
